# ViveServer

Python based package for running a central server that connects to SteamVR via pyopenvr and broadcasts tracker data to clients, which publish odemetry data via ROS2. 

Includes a user interface on the server for listing and plotting active devices, as well as calibrating the coordinate system based on reference trackers.
